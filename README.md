### What I learned

Iâ€™ve really learned a lot from JavaScript, especially its OOP concepts. It was really hard at first when I tried to figure out how to get the result I wanted, but after a while, I finally got it. It made me realize that breaking a big problem into smaller steps really helps.

By the way, the code below is for getting an object with the values of code and name.

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  const names = detail?.borders.map((code) => {
    const match = countryName?.find((country) => country.alpha3Code === code);
    return match
      ? { code: match.alpha3Code, name: match.name }
      : { code, name: code };
  });
};
```

### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This helped me to do the styling more easy. I really liked this tailwindcss and will use it going forward.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com) - This is an amazing website which helped me to upload my website into the internet. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning to use this website.
